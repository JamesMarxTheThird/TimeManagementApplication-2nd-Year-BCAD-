----------- Time Management Application - James Marx - Read Me -----------
Done while at Varsity College, Second Year studying BCAD. 



<Introduction> 

This app was built to help those like myself who struggle to do things before hand, and manage their time well.

People can insert values relating to their course, and this program will process them to let the user know
how many hours they should be wokring in a week and how many are left after a studying session.

This may seem quite complex but I promise its very easy to use! The program has been equipped with many 
instructions and well as features in order for you to be able to follow along and not enter incorrect values.

While designing this I learnt things like efficiently handling errors that may occur, done by restricting 
values that shouldnt be processed e.g the moduleCredits textbox only accepts numbers.

Also learnt alot about the design part of wpf, making it looks neat, consistent, not too flashy. And importantly
selecting when and when not to persist data between pages depending on your desired output.

The most interesting part of this for me, was learning LINQ queries as I really enjoy sql. They are very interesting
and have proven to be very effective when manipulating data. Can't wait to use them with databases.

<Getting Started>

To get started on your time management journey, you will first have to open the "20102645_TimeManagement_App"

At the top of Visual Studios underneath the menu item "Tools" you will see a Start button, press it to run the app

The first page is just a welcome page, feel free to observe the art otherwise press start 

//If at any time running this program you want to end or minimize it just look at the top right. x = end || - = minimize

//Also if program has error ... already contains a definition for ExitButton please ingnore it as it will still run 100%

You will land on the Moudle page, here you just need to follow label instructions, fill in the textboxes and fields then click appropriate buttons.
The add module button will keep you on this page and add a module to the ModuleList.
The other "Working Hours" button will take you to the next page if you want to deduct certain hours from a week.

If you clicked the "Working Hours" button you will be on the working hours page

Here you must type the module name word for word, then select a date this week and the hours to deduct. Once these fileds have been filled
with the appropriate data, the software will display the remaining hours needed to study.

You can select other dates this week and deduct more hours, this will help to see if you are on track for this current week!

After this you are done! You can either close or return to home. Feel free to run this app whenever you need to monitor your self study hours.
